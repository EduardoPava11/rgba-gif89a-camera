# RGBA→GIF89a App Test Report

## Test Execution Summary

**Date:** 2024-08-12  
**Device:** Samsung Phone (R5CX62YBM4H)  
**Android Version:** 14  
**Package:** com.rgbagif.debug  
**Status:** PARTIAL FAIL

## Installation & Launch

✅ APK installed successfully  
✅ MainActivity launched  
✅ Camera permission granted  
✅ App process running  

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Missing Native Libraries
- **Error:** `dlopen failed: library "libuniffi_gifpipe.so" not found`
- **Impact:** Rust CBOR processing functionality unavailable
- **Root Cause:** Native libraries not properly included in APK build

### 2. Memory Pressure
- Multiple GC events observed
- App experiencing heap allocation issues (256MB limit reached)
- Camera preview appears to be consuming excessive memory

### 3. Missing Canonical Log Events
The following expected log events were NOT found:
- `M1_START`
- `M1_FRAME_SAVED` 
- `M2_START`
- `M2_FRAME_DONE`
- `M3_START`
- `CAMERA_INIT` with RGBA format

## Partial Success

✅ App initialization: `APP_START { version: "1.0", versionCode: 1 }`  
✅ Camera surface created and rendering at 30fps  
✅ No fatal crashes (app remains running)  

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue is that the Rust native libraries (M1Fast JNI and M2Down) are not included in the APK. This needs to be resolved by:

1. Building the Rust libraries for Android:
   ```bash
   cd rust-core/m1fast
   ./build_android.sh
   cd ../m2down  
   ./build_android.sh
   ```

2. Ensuring the .so files are copied to the correct JNI libs directory:
   ```
   app/src/main/jniLibs/
   ├── arm64-v8a/
   │   ├── libm1fast.so
   │   └── libm2down.so
   └── armeabi-v7a/
       ├── libm1fast.so
       └── libm2down.so
   ```

3. Rebuilding the APK with native libraries included

## Recommendations

1. **Fix native library inclusion** - Build Rust modules and ensure .so files are in jniLibs
2. **Add memory profiling** - Camera preview may need optimization for 729×729 resolution
3. **Add UI feedback** - Progress indicators for M1→M2→M3 pipeline stages
4. **Implement proper error handling** - Graceful fallback when native libs unavailable

## Artifacts Collected

- `run.log` - Full logcat output
- `app_state.png` - Screenshot showing camera preview active

## Next Steps

1. Build Rust native libraries for Android
2. Rebuild APK with libraries included
3. Re-run test with verification script
4. Monitor memory usage during capture
